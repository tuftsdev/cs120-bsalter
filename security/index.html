    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        I was hired to provide a security assessment of a back-end written in Node.js. The task is to uncover and report on any
        security or privacy vulnerabilities that I discover as a result of auditing the source code. The client believes there are at least
        three potential vectors of attack, although more may be present.
    </p>
    <p>
        OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities are highest priority, particularly SQL injection vectors.
    </p>
    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p> 
        Prior to investigating code, I used black-box testing to search for likely vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subsequent to black-box testing, the primary mode of insepction is an in-depth, line-by-line code audit, 
        backed up by sending curl requests to verify findings. The code was deployed to a Heroku cloud server for testing.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, the OWASP ZAP tool was used to determine if there are problems with headers that could expose the server.</p>
    <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
    <p>
        Three very significant problems were found when investigating this back-end code, which could open the system to attack
        and potentially your company to a lawsuit. In brief, it is currently possible for an attacker to damage your database,
        download private passenger data, or 'fake' your site to steal your customer's data. We suggest remediating these problems 
        immediately, as they are non-complex and could be rectified in under a day's typical work period.
    </p>
    <h1>Issues Found</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Issue: SQL Injection vulnerability</li>
                <li>Location: line 90</li>
                <li>Severity: Critical, arbitrary SQL can be run against the server</li>
                <li>
                    Description: A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the GET vehicle.json endpoint which would allow
                    hackers to run their own SQL queries against the database. They could potentially use this to erase or
                    alter records. Found this issue during code-audit and using the curl command.
                </li>
                <li>Proof: <img src="sql.png" class="privacy-image" /></li>
                <li>Resolution: Change this query to use a 'prepare'-style, similar to lines 29 & 56.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Issue: GPS coords of users are saved to database</li>
                <li>Location: line 29</li>
                <li>Severity: Severe, because passenger data can currently be downloaded</li>
                <li>
                    Description: This is a privacy issue - user details are sent to the database and saved there, with no encryption.
                    Found this issue when examining the database and during code audit.
                </li>
                <li>Proof: <img src="privacy.png" class="privacy-image" /></li>
                <li>
                    Resolution: Encrypt user details like lat/lng coordinates. Institute a policy of deleting this sensitive 
                    data periodically.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Issue: Missing Headers</li>
                <li>Location: All endpoints</li>
                <li>Severity: Medium, opens the door to possible click-jacking possibility</li>
                <li>
                    Description: The header Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options is missing from
                    the header, which opens the door to possible click-jacking attacks. See: 
                    https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking
                    Found this issue while running the OWASP ZAP tool.
                </li>
                <li>Proof: <img src="clickjack.png" class="privacy-image"/></li>
                <li>Resolution: Add this header to all server responses.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        Several very-high vulnerabilities exist on your site. We recommend you assign a skilled developer to repair these deficiencies
        before a hacker or other unscrupulous individual discovers them. In particular, the opportunity to download passenger lat/lng 
        locations is concerning.
        I would anticipate the price of repairing these vulnerabilities to be &lt; $1000, depending on software developer rates and cost to
        deploy.
