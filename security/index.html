    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        I was hired to provide a security assessment of a back-end written in Node.js. The task is to uncover and report on any
        security or privacy vulnerabilities that I discover as a result of auditing the source code. The client believes there are at least
        three potential vectors of attack, although more may be present.
    </p>
    <p>
        OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities are highest priority, particularly SQL injection vectors.
    </p>
    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p> 
        Prior to investigating code, I used black-box testing to search for likely vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subsequent to black-box testing, the primary mode of insepction is an in-depth, line-by-line code audit, 
        backed up by sending curl requests to verify findings. The code was deployed to a Heroku cloud server for testing.
    </p>
    <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>Issues Found</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Issue: SQL Injection vulnerability</li>
                <li>Location: line 90</li>
                <li>Severity: Critical</li>
                <li>
                    Description: A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the GET vehicle.json endpoint which would allow
                    hackers to run their own SQL queries against the database. They could potentially use this to erase or
                    alter records.
                </li>
                <li>Proof: 

                </li>
                <li>Resolution: Change this query to use a 'prepare'-style, similar to lines 29 & 56.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Issue: GPS coords of users are saved to database</li>
                <li>Location: line 29</li>
                <li>Severity: Medium</li>
                <li>Description: This is a privacy issue - user details are sent to the database and saved there, with no encryption.</li>
                <li>Proof: <img src="privacy.png" class="privacy-image" /></li>
                <li>
                    Resolution: Encrypt user details like lat/lng coordinates. Institute a policy of deleting this sensitive 
                    data periodically.
                </li>
